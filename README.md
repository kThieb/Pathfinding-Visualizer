# pathfinding-visualizer
 
This project is a little project about visualizing fundamental graph algorithms: pathfinding algorithms:

At the moment I only implemented Dijkstra's algorithm to make a proof of concept.

There are a few features: 
<ul>
 <li>Maze generation with changeable density of walls</li>
 <li>Visualizing Dijktra's algorithm</li>
</ul>
